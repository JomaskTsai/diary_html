</p>

<h2>Host Computer Requirements</h2>
<p>
DS-5 requires a minimum specification of computer with a dual core 2GHz
processor (or equivalent) and 2GB of RAM. 4GB or more of RAM is recommended
to improve performance when debugging large images,  or when using the simulation
models. A full installation requires approximately 3GB of hard disk space. A 
minimum screen resolution of 1024x768 is required.
</p>
<p>
DS-5 is supported on the following host platforms and service packs:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1</span></li>
<li><span>Windows 7 Enterprise Service Pack 1</span></li>
<li><span>Windows 8 (64-bit only) (ARM Compiler 5 and 6 toolchains only)</span></li>
<li><span>Windows Server 2012 (ARM Compiler 5 and 6 toolchains only)</span></li>
<li><span>Windows Server 2008 R2 (ARM Compiler 5 toolchain only)</span></li>
<li><span>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Desktop with Workstation option <b>[deprecated: support for this platform will be removed in a future DS-5 release]</b></span></li>
<li><span>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Workstation</span></li>
<li><span>Ubuntu Desktop Edition 14.04 LTS (64-bit only)</span></li>
<li><span>Ubuntu Desktop Edition 12.04 LTS</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
DS-5 Ultimate Edition is supported on 64-bit host platforms only.
</p>
<p>
ARM Compiler 6 is only supplied in the 64-bit installation of DS-5. For 32-bit installations of DS-5,
you can download ARM Compiler 6 from <a href="http://ds.arm.com/downloads/compilers/">http://ds.arm.com/downloads/compilers/</a>.
</p>
<p>
All line drawings in the online help use SVG format. To view these graphics, your
browser must support the SVG format.
</p>
<p>
DS-5 can co-exist with the earlier ARM RVDS toolchain provided that they are installed into separate directories.
</p>

<h2>Debug System Requirements</h2>
<p>
Android and ARM Linux application debug require gdbserver be available on your target. Depending
on your chosen connection type, DS-5 Debugger might be able to copy gdbserver to the target for
you, but otherwise you must copy it yourself.
The recommended version of gdbserver is 7.0 or higher. gdbserver executables, built for 
Android and ARM Linux, that are compatible with DS-5 Debugger are provided in the 
<tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/arm/gdbserver</tt> directory. gdbserver executables for Android have been
tested against Android Virtual Devices Froyo-v2.2 to ICS-v4.0. DS-5 Debugger is unable to
provide reliable multi-threaded debug support with gdbserver versions prior to 6.8.
</p>
<p>
Linux application rewind is supported for AArch32 architecture applications only, and
requires undodb-server to be available on your target.
DS-5 Debugger copies undodb-server to the target for you in the Download and Debug connection type,
but for all other connection types you must copy it yourself. The undodb-server binary can be found in the
<tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/arm/undodb/linux</tt> directory within your installation. Application rewind does not
follow forked processes or allow modification of register values.
</p>
<p>
DS-5 support for Android and Linux depends upon infrastructure and features
introduced in specific kernel versions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>
    DS-5 Debugger supports debugging NDK-generated native libraries on Android versions 2.2, 2.3.x,
    3.x.x, and 4.0.
</span></li>
<li><span>
    DS-5 Debugger supports debugging ARM Linux kernel versions 2.6.28 and later. 
</span></li>
<li><span>
    ARM Streamline Performance Analyzer supports ARM Linux kernel versions 3.4 and later.
</span></li>
<li><span>
    Application debug on SMP systems requires ARM Linux kernel version 2.6.36 or later.
</span></li>
<li><span>
    Access to VFP and NEON registers requires
    ARM Linux kernel version 2.6.30 or later and gdbserver version 7.0 or later.
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
ARM Linux kernel and bare-metal debugging require the use of additional tools (not supplied
with DS-5) to connect to your target system. DSTREAM, RVI, ULINKpro and ULINKpro D debug units
allow connection to physical hardware targets. VSTREAM allows connection
to RTL simulators and hardware emulators. ARMv8 bare-metal debugging is only supported when
using DSTREAM and VSTREAM with a DS-5 Ultimate Edition license.
</p>
<p>
The minimum supported firmware version for DSTREAM, RVI and VSTREAM is 4.24.0. For DSTREAM
and RVI it is recommended that you use the supplied debug hardware update tool to check that
you are using the latest firmware and to update it if necessary. Updated firmware is available
in the <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/sw/debughw/firmware</tt> directory. The firmware for VSTREAM
is delivered as part of the VSTREAM software, so you must obtain and install a newer version
of this product if the firmware version is too old.
</p>
<!--
For ULINK2 you must upgrade to CMSIS-DAP compatible firmware. Updated firmware and associated
instructions are available in the <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/sw/debughw/ULINK2</tt> directory.
-->

<h2><a name="installonlinux">Install on Linux</a></h2>
<p>
Separate installable products are provided for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux. Although
you can install the 32-bit product on 64-bit Linux, it is recommended to
install the 64-bit product instead. The 64-bit product is for use on 64-bit Linux
only, and is capable of processing larger data sets and suffers from fewer
operating system compatibility issues than the 32-bit product.
</p>
<p>
To install DS-5 on Linux, run (not source) <tt>install.sh</tt> and follow the
on-screen instructions. The installer unpacks DS-5 into your chosen directory,
adds desktop shortcuts, and optionally installs support for hardware debug units.
It is recommended that you delete any previous release of DS-5 before installing
this release. The installer guides you through this process.
Alternatively you can install this release into a different directory.
</p>
<p>
The tools installed by both 32-bit and 64-bit installers have dependencies
on 32-bit system libraries. You must ensure that 32-bit compatibility libraries
are installed when using DS-5 on 64-bit Linux host platforms. DS-5 tools might
fail to run or report errors about missing libraries if 32-bit compatibility
libraries are not installed. The ARM Knowledgebase contains further information 
about the required DS-5 dependencies:
<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka14522.html">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka14522.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The installer includes configuration files to allow USB connection to DSTREAM,
RVI, ULINKpro and ULINKpro D hardware debug units. It is recommended to install these files if you
intend to use these features. Installation of these files requires that you
run the installer with root privileges. If you do not run the installer
with root privileges or choose not to install these files, then you can still
install them after installation by running the
<tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/run_post_install_for_ARM_DS-5.sh</tt> script with root
privileges. The installer creates a desktop menu using the freedesktop.org
menu system on supported Linux platforms.
</p>

<h2>Install on Windows</h2>
<p>
Separate installable products are provided for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. Although
you can install the 32-bit product on 64-bit Windows, it is recommended to
install the 64-bit product instead. The 64-bit product is for use on 64-bit Windows
only, and is capable of processing larger data sets than the 32-bit product.
</p>
<p>
To install DS-5 on Windows, run <tt>setup.exe</tt> and follow the on-screen
instructions. If you have an earlier version of DS-5 already installed, this one will be installed
alongside, without uninstalling your previous installation.
</p>
<p>
During installation you might be prompted to install device drivers.
These drivers are to allow USB connections to DSTREAM, RVI, ULINKpro, ULINKpro D and
Energy Probe hardware units.
It is recommended to install these drivers if you intend to use these
features. You might receive warnings such as "Windows can't verify the publisher
of this driver software" or "The software you are installing has not passed
Windows Logo testing". You can safely ignore these warnings and continue with
installation.
</p>
<p>
Command-line installation and uninstallation are possible on Windows by opening a command prompt, 
with administrative privileges, and running Microsoft's installer, <tt>msiexec.exe</tt>. You must 
provide the location of the <tt>.msi</tt> file as an argument to <tt>msiexec</tt>. You can get a 
full list of options for using <tt>msiexec</tt> by running <tt>msiexec /?</tt> on the command-line.
An example of how to install DS-5 using <tt>msiexec</tt> is:
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<pre>
msiexec.exe /i &lt;installer location&gt;\data\install.msi EULA=1 /qn /l*v install.log
</pre>
</div>
Where:
<ul>
<li><span><tt>/i</tt>: this option is to perform the installation.</span></li>
<li><span><tt>&lt;installer location&gt;\data\install.msi</tt>: this specifies the full pathname of 
the <tt>.msi</tt> file to install.</span></li>
<li><span><tt>EULA=1</tt>: this is an ARM specific option. Setting EULA to 1 means you accept the 
End User License Agreement (EULA). You must read the EULA in the GUI installer before accepting it 
on the command-line.</span></li>
<li><span><tt>/qn</tt>: this option specifies quiet mode, so that the installation does not require 
user interaction. Note device driver installation still requires user interaction. If you do not 
require USB drivers or if you want the installation to avoid user interaction for USB drivers, you 
can use <tt>SKIP_DRIVERS=1</tt> option on the command-line.</span></li>
<li><span><tt>/l*v install.log</tt>: this option specifies the log file to log all output from the 
installation.</span></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>After Install</h2>
<p>
After installation, you can start Eclipse for DS-5 from the
<span class="guiref">ARM DS-5 v5.22.0 -> Eclipse for DS-5 v5.22.0</span>
entry in your desktop menu. Be aware that any existing "Eclipse for DS-5" entry in the desktop menu
will point to the previous version of DS-5 that is still available for use on your host. Eclipse
for DS-5 and other supplied tools can also be found within the <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin</tt>
directory.
</p>
<p>
Portions of DS-5 are license managed and you must install a license before using
them. See the Obtaining and Installing Your License section of these release notes
below for further information about this.
</p>
<p>
The installer does not modify any environment variables on your system. To run
the tools more easily from a console you can manually add the
<tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin</tt> directory to your
<tt>PATH</tt> environment variable. You should be aware that DS-5 includes copies
of gcc and make that might behave differently from any copies that are installed
elsewhere on your system. For this reason, if you modify your PATH environment
variable, it is recommended that you do this locally within a console rather than
globally for your entire system. See your operating system documentation for
further information on setting environment variables.
</p>
<p>
On Linux you can run <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/suite_exec <em>&lt;shell&gt;</em></tt>
to open a shell with the PATH environment variable correctly configured. Run this
tool with no arguments for more help.
</p>
<p>
On Windows the Start menu contains <span class="guiref">DS-5 Command Prompt</span>.
This console is preconfigured with the <tt>bin</tt> directory added to the
<tt>PATH</tt> environment variable.
</p>
<p>On both Linux and Windows the command prompts do not provide a compiler toolchain
by default, but you can select one using the <tt>select_toolchain</tt> or
<tt>select_default_toolchain</tt> commands.
</p>
<p>
Further information on using DS-5 can be found in the on-line
help within Eclipse for DS-5. To access the on-line help, start Eclipse for DS-5 and
select <span class="guiref">Help</span> -> <span class="guiref">Help Contents</span>.
The main documentation for DS-5 can be found under the
<span class="guiref">DS-5 Documentation</span> section in the contents.
</p>
<p>
Separate documentation is provided for the supplied examples in the
<tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/examples/docs/index.html</tt> document, which is also
linked to from the <span class="guiref">Examples Index</span> menu entry in the
<span class="guiref">ARM DS-5 v5.22.0</span> Windows Start menu.
</p>
<p>
You can find further instructions on installation, licensing and tutorials
on-line at:
<a href="http://ds.arm.com/developer-resources/tutorials/working-with-arm-ds-5/">http://ds.arm.com/developer-resources/tutorials/working-with-arm-ds-5/</a>.
</p>

<h2>Obtaining and Installing Your License</h2>
<p>
You must obtain a valid license before using DS-5. 
</p>
<p>
You can use the License Manager dialog in Eclipse for DS-5 to obtain and install node-locked licenses on
both Windows and Linux. You can open this dialog by selecting ARM License Manager
in the Eclipse for DS-5 Help menu. You must also select a toolkit. The toolkit identifies which
specific license you are using in the event that you have multiple licenses installed.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, floating and commercial (paid-for) node-locked licenses can be obtained and installed manually. Further instructions on
this can be found in the <span class="bookref">ARM DS-5 License Management
Guide</span> document in the <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/documents</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
When the license and toolkit are configured within Eclipse then all license managed
components will pick up the license and toolkit settings correctly, both within Eclipse and within
the provided DS-5 Command Prompt (Windows) or suite_exec shell (Linux). If you use a different console then
you must configure the tools manually. To do this set the environment
variable ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE to point at your license file, and ensure that the
license managed compilation tools (armcc, armasm, armlink and fromelf) are passed
the option <tt>--tool_variant=&lt;toolkit&gt;</tt> on each invocation. The argument to
tool_variant is the type of license to use and corresponds to the prefix used
by the license features in your license file up to the first '_' character. For
example, if your license file contains a feature named &quot;ds5eval_compiler5&quot;
then you must pass the compilation tools the <tt>--tool_variant=ds5eval</tt> option.
Failure to set either the license location or the toolkit can result in errors
reporting a failure to checkout a license, for example &quot;Cannot obtain license for...&quot;
</p>
<p>
Consult the License Management FAQ at
<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/kiLwjCHu92xQmR.html">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/kiLwjCHu92xQmR.html</a>
for more assistance with the installation of your license.
</p>
<p>
Contact <a href="mailto:license.support@arm.com">license.support@arm.com</a> if you
need additional help with registering or obtaining your license. Please provide your
serial number, a detailed description of the problem, and your ARM web licensing
system username and password. 
</p>
<p>
If you are using floating licenses, then the version of the FlexNet license server
software must be greater or equal to the version of FlexNet used within the DS-5 tools.
This release of DS-5 contains tools based on FlexNet 11.12.1.0, along with FlexNet
server binaries version 11.12.1.0.
</p>

<h2>Compilers</h2>
<p>
DS-5 is supplied with two versions of ARM Compiler for compiling bare-metal applications.
ARM Compiler 5 supports all ARM architectures except ARMv8. ARM Compiler 6 supports
architectures ARMv8 and ARMv7-A, as well as alpha support for architectures ARMv7-R,
ARMv7-M and ARMv6-M. Use of ARMv8 support requires a DS-5 Ultimate Edition license.
</p>
<p>
Both versions of ARM Compiler are license managed and not all editions of DS-5 include
a license for it. If your edition of DS-5 does not include a license for ARM Compiler,
or you are developing applications for a non-bare-metal case, such as Linux applications,
then you might require the use of a third-party compiler.
</p>
<p>
Linaro GCC Toolchain 4.8-2014.04 is provided for Linux applications and Linux kernel
development targeting the AArch32 architecture. Other releases of GCC are available at
<a href="https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries/">https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries/</a>.
</p>

<!--
<p>
GCC is one such toolchain that you can use as an alternative to ARM Compiler. The GCC
toolchain allows you to compile bare-metal, Linux kernel and Linux applications. Linaro provide
pre-built versions of GCC on their website. For example:
</p>
<p>
GCC for Linux kernel and applications (2013.02 release):

For ease of use and to be able to use the tools from Eclipse IDE, ensure that the installed
/ extracted binaries are present on the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable, for example
<tt>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Linaro\gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.7-2013.02-01\bin&quot;</tt>.
Newer releases of GCC might be made available on this website from time-to-time. Older
releases are also available.
</p>
<p>
The pre-built bare-metal examples supplied with DS-5 are built with ARM Compiler.
The pre-built Linux application examples are built with Linaro's GCC 4.8-2014.04 release.

<h2>Uninstall</h2>
<p>
To uninstall DS-5 on Windows, use <span class="guiref">Add or Remove
Programs</span> in <span class="guiref">Control Panel</span>, select
<span class="guiref">ARM DS-5 v5.22.0</span> and click the
<span class="guiref">Remove</span> button.
</p>
<p>
To uninstall DS-5 on Linux, run <tt>remove_menus_for_ARM_DS-5.sh</tt> in the
root directory of your installation to remove desktop menu entries, and then
simply delete the installation directory.
</p>
<p>
On both Windows and Linux, some per-user configuration is stored outside
of the installation directory, which you might optionally choose to delete.
For Windows these files are stored in <tt>%APPDATA%\ARM</tt>.
For Linux these files are stored in <tt>$HOME/.ds-5</tt> and <tt>$HOME/.arm</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>
<p>
The following known issues and limitations exist in this release:
</p>

<h3>Eclipse for DS-5</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> Eclipse fails to start and reports &quot;cannot restore segment 
    prot after reloc: Permission denied&quot; [SDDEBUG-13327]
    <br>
    <strong>Workaround:</strong> This error occurs because some of the shared libraries used 
    by the applications require text relocation, but the Security-enhanced Linux 
    (SELinux) policy on your machine prohibits this. To work around this, change the 
    SELinux policy for your DS-5 applications and shared libraries to allow text relocation. This 
    can be achieved with the following command, run under a super user account:<p>
    <tt>chcon -R -t texrel_shlib_t &quot;&lt;installdir>&quot;</tt></p>
</p></li>
<li><p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong> Eclipse fails to start and reports &quot;JVM terminated&quot; or
    outputs a stack backtrace. [SDDEBUG-4443]
    <br>
    <strong>Workaround:</strong> This problem is often caused by heap settings for Eclipse that
    are not suitable for the computer that you are running it on. To fix this you
    must edit <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/sw/eclipse/eclipse.ini</tt> to supply alternative
    heap settings. The following knowledgebase article provides detailed instructions
    on making this change: <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka14185.html">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka14185.html</a>.
